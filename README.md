Machine Learning Programs in Python and R

The programs in this file are codes I built in two differing machine learning classes taken in line with the Applied Statistics Master's program at CSU Long Beach. The PDF and Word documents show the output and analysis of the programs. These PDF/Word documents also contain output and codes from SAS and SAS Enterprise, but the actual programs were lost. Certain algorithms are not compatible across all three languages, so there will be missing codes for select files.
